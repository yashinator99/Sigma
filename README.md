# Python With Automation Environment Setup Guide
---

## Purpose

> This document provides a list of the required technologies for anyone who will be going through the Python/Automation program. It details why each technology is required and provides some step-by-step instructions on how to install and configure the technologies. This guide also walks you through any needed environment setup.

**NOTE**: It is **very** important that you install these technologies as soon as possible, environment setup will not be covered during the lessons. It is also key that you install the correct versions of the tools listed here as not all versions of the technologies we will use are guaranteed to be compatible with each other. If you are unsure about it, check online or with your team.
Windows 10 is the assumed default operating system. If you choose to use a different operating system or version of one of the tools listed here, you will be **responsible** for debugging issues that are specific to your development environment.

## Required Technologies

The following technologies and/or services are **required** for this program:

- **Java SE Development Kit 8**: We will be utilizing Java 8 as one of our primary languages for the duration of the program. This software development kit will provide the compiler and runtime environment needed to quickly and efficiently develop Java applications.

- **Apache Maven**: Maven is a software project management and build automation tool. We will use it to manage our projects' builds as it provides dependency management and streamlines several aspects of the testing life cycle.

- **Git**: We'll be using Git as a version control tool during the course of this program. Not only will you use Git to track changes to your projects, but you'll also use it to collaborate with your trainer and with your fellow associates.

- **Git Bash**: We will be using git bash as our terminal of choice, while the windows system comes with a built in terminal with CMD or Powershell, most remote servers are built on linux and do not use these terminals. This is where Git Bash comes in, it is a linux-style Command Line Interface for windows and integrates with git cleanly.

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Amazon Web Services offers cost-effective, scalable cloud computing solutions. We will be using AWS for its Relational Database Service (RDS). There are no instructions below on how to sign up for an account as the process if straightforward. Simply [visit AWS' website](https://aws.amazon.com/) and register for an account; make sure that you select a **personal** account as personal accounts are allotted a year's worth of free tier cloud resources.

- **DBeaver**: DBeaver is a free, open source universal database tool that is compatible with several external data sources, PostgreSQL included. We'll use DBeaver in order to modify our databases and persist data using a simple user interface provided to us by the tool. While DBeaver is an IDE for the sql management, I have placed this as required as the alternative will be too much to manage as a new developer.

- **Postman**: Postman is used for testing RESTful APIs. We'll use it to set up collections of tests for the RESTful APIs we design throughout the program. It can also be used to quickly test a single endpoint.

- **Python**: We will be using Python 3 as one of our primary languages for the duration of the program. This Python installation will provide the standard library, preferred installer program, and several other components that make building and running Python applications possible.

- **PostgreSQL ODBC Driver**: When building Python applications, we will utilize `pyodbc`, a PyPI module that makes accessing ODBC databases easy. As such, you'll need to download and configure a Postgres-specific ODBC driver.

Optional

- **PostgreSQL 10**: PostgreSQL is an open source relational database. We will leverage this technology in order to persist and organize data. Though you are expected to use AWS' Relational Database Service to host your database for projects in their production environments, you are welcome to download Postgres to your local host while working with your application in a development environment.

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment) / Text Editors

> Understand that an IDE is not essential to programming, it provides a lot of helpful features like autocorrect and error checking, a handy editor and terminal to make testing and debugging easier, clear file structure, and more. However, the IDE itself is basically a glorified text editor, even notepad.exe is fine to use to make programs so don't confuse the IDE with the program, it is still only a tool used to make the program, not the program itself. 

- **Visual Studio Code**: Visual Studio Code is a text editor that makes viewing and modifying code simple. However, this actually leads to its greatest benefit as it is light weight and fast unlike a typical IDE as a lot of extra features that are not needed does not come preinstalled. If you wish to add any extra features / plugins to aid your development experience, there are many Visual Studio Extensions that can be installed within the application. 

- **Intellij Community Edition (Optional)**: Intellij community edition is an excellent Java focused IDE. Make sure to install the community edition instead of the ultimate as that begins with a free trial and then requires a subscription. Intellij also has a plugin market that can further enhance your programming experience.

- **PyCharm (Optional)**: PyCharm acts as an integrated development environment for Python. Again, an IDE is not required, but it is useful for rapid development.

## Installation Methods

There are two provided methods of attaining and configuring all of the necessary tools listed above:

1. Via a *package manager* or command-line installer
2. Manually downloading the necessary software

Neither method is more "correct" than the other. You should choose the method of attaining the tools that works best for you. You may even choose to mix both methods, downloading some tools manually and others via a package manager.


## Video walkthrough (Method 1)

[![PWA Environment Setup](./images/thumbnail.png)](https://vimeo.com/692694597)


<details><summary>Method 1: Installation Guide Using A Package Manager</summary>
<p>
A *package manager* is a command line tool that allows you to install and manage software. You can use a package manager to install all of the software listed here.

The package manager that we'll be using for this guide is called "Scoop". It's a command-line installer for Windows, which means that you'll have to be running Windows in order to use this tool. You'll also need PowerShell 5 (or a later version) installed.

**Note**: If you are not running Windows and still want to use a package manager, feel free to do so. You'll have to, however, know how to use your package manager of choice as there won't be instructions provided here since there are many package managers available. **If you do not wish to use a package manager, please skip to method 2.**
</p>
    
    
### Step 1: Install Scoop

In order to use Scoop, you'll first have to install it. This installation requires that you have PowerShell 5 or later.

Once you've verified that you have a compatible version of PowerShell, launch PowerShell. You can launch PowerShell by searching for it in the Windows search bar. Then go to [Scoop's official website](https://scoop.sh/). Once on the homepage, scroll to the bottom of the page until you see the following:

![Scoop instructions](./images/scoop-instructions.PNG)

As Scoop's installation instructions indicate, you can run one of the following commands in PowerShell (NOT both):

Option 1:

    Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')

Option 2:

    iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex

If you run one of these commands and it fails, you'll need to first run the following command:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser

After you've run this command, you should then attempt to run one of the first two commands again.

### Step 2: Configure Scoop

When installed, Scoop comes with a default bucket titled "main". Since some of the programs we'll install using Scoop aren't contained in this bucket, we'll add some additional buckets before we begin installing our programs.

Open a new terminal and run the following commands (one by one):

    scoop bucket add extras
    scoop bucket add java
    scoop bucket add versions

**Note**: If you receive a warning that says that the bucket you're attempting to add already exists, you don't have to worry as this means that you already have that bucket.
    
### Step 3: Install Git

Now that you've installed Scoop and added some additional buckets for downloading software, open a new terminal and run the following command in order to install Git:

    scoop install git

After the installation is complete, verify that you have installed Git properly by typing the following in your terminal:

    git --version

### Step 4: Install Java

In order to install Java, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install ojdkbuild8-full

Now verify that you have installed Java properly by typing this command:

     java -version

### Step 5: Install Spring Tool Suite 4

In order to install Intellij IDEA community edition java IDE, run this command in your terminal:

    scoop install idea

If your installation was successful, you should now be able to search for "Spring Tool Suite" in your Windows search bar.

### Step 6: Install Maven

In order to install Maven, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install maven

Verify that your Maven installation was successful by typing the following:

    mvn -version

### Step 7: Install DBeaver

In order to install DBeaver, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install dbeaver

You can verify that you have installed DBeaver properly by searching for "DBeaver" in your Windows search bar.

### Step 8: Install Postman

In order to install Postman, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install postman

Verify that the program was installed properly by searching for "Postman" in your windows search bar.

### Step 9: Install Python

In order to install Python, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install python39

Verify that your Python installation was successful by typing the following in your terminal:

    python --version

### Step 10: Install PyCharm

In order to install PyCharm, run the following command in your terminal:

    scopp install pycharm

If your installation was successful, you should now be able to search for "PyCharm" in your Windows search bar.

### Step 11: Install The PostgreSQL ODBC Driver

Scoop does not support the installation of the PostgreSQL ODBC Driver. As such, please skip to the [manual installation subsection](#step-10-install-the-postgresql-odbc-driver) which details how to install the driver.

### Step 12: Install PostgreSQL (Optional)

In order to install PostgreSQL, we will NOT be using Scoop as we require PostgreSQL 10, a version that is not currently supported by Scoop. That said, we will manually download the PostgreSQL installer visiting the [official website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).

Once you've navigated to the website, you should see the following:

![Postgres Download Home](./images/postgres-download.PNG)

Please look at the row for **version 10.13** as we will downloading this version. Select the download link which corresponds with your system and click it.

You'll then be prompted to save the file. Click "Save File".

![Save Postgres Installer](./images/save-postgres.PNG)

The file should now be located in your "Downloads" folder.

![Postgres In Downloads Folder](./images/postgres-in-downloads.PNG)

Double click the file, which should launch the installer. You might be asked if you want the application to make changes to your device. Say "yes".

You'll be presented with several menus in the Setup Wizard.

![Postgres Setup Wizard](./images/postgres-setup.PNG)

Hit "Next" until you get to the "Select Components" menu. Here, you'll want to select and/or deselect the following and then click "Next":

![Postgres Components](./images/postgres-components.PNG)

Continue to hit "Next" until you reach the "Password" menu. Here you will be tasked with providing a password for the default Postgres user (which is "postgres"). The password is completely up to you. That said, DO NOT forget your password as you won't be able to login to your database as the superuser. If you have to, write your password down somewhere or use a password manager.

![Postgres Password](./images/postgres-password.PNG)

After you've decided on a password, hit "Next" on the remaining menus and allow time for Postgres to be installed. Once the installation is complete, you might be asked if you want to launch Stack Builder. You can say "no".

PostgreSQL should now be successfully installed on your computer.

### Step 13: Install Visual Studio Code (Optional)

In order to install Visual Studio Code, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install vscode

If the installation was successful, you should be able to search for "Visual Studio Code" in the Windows search bar.

</details>
    
    
<details><summary>Method 2: Manual Installation</summary>

This method is compatible with all environments as it does not require any platform-specific package managers. You need only visit the official websites for each of the technologies listed and download the version of the tool that is compatible with your system.

Do note, however, that setting system environment variables differs from machine to machine. This guide shows how to set environment variables on a Windows machine.

The first thing you'll want to do is open your web browser of choice. This guide will use *Chrome*.

**Note**: Many of the tools that you will install have different system installers that are platform dependent. It is **very** important that you download the correct installer. The following list details how you should choose the installer for a program:

- If you have a 32-bit version of Windows, use the installer that is marked as the 32-bit version.
- If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, use the installer that is marked as the 64-bit version.
- If you have a Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora), you should choose the installer that matches your distribution.
- If you have a Mac, you should choose the installer that is marked as the Mac installer.

These options will be clearly labeled on the websites you visit to download the technologies. If you're not sure how to figure out what version of the Windows operating system you're running, do the following:

[![Video Guide to find System Driver](./images/systemInfo.png)](https://vimeo.com/693811800)

1. Type "Control Panel" into the Windows search bar and click on the "Control Panel" app.
2. Select "System and Security".
3. Select "System".

You should now see the following screen:
