### 2. Party at Charlie's

Daniel's house is next to Greta's house.
Greta's house is next to Benita's.
Adam lives directly across the street from Daniel.
Elena lives to the west of Benita (to the left, across Benita's house).
Hal lives to the East of Benita to the right, across Benita's house).
Franco lives east of Hal (cause Elena has to cross 3 streets, 1, to Elena's, 2 to Hal's, and the third to franco's, cause they all live close by).
Adam lives to the east of Daniel, cause they all live close by, Elena would have to walk 3 streets west, which is far from Hal and Franco).
I think Charlie's house is across Greta's, to the East.
