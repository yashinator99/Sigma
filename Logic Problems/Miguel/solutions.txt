## Summer Camp

Since abigail's favourite activy isn't rock climbing, then abigail's favourite activity can be
1. cooking
2. kayaking
3. zip-line

Oliver is afraid heights, therefore he doesn't like rock climbing or zip-line. His favourite activity can be
1. cooking
2. kayaking

Rose can't do her favourite activiy without a harness means that her favourite activity can either be
1. rock climbing
2. zip-line

Finally, blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times so their favourite activity isn't kayaking, rock climbing or zip-line.
So their favourite activity must be

1. Cooking

Blake - Cooking

Now of the remaining people only Rose has rock climbing as a possible favourite activity.

Blake - Cooking
Rose - Rock Climbing

Looking at Oliver out of the only two possible options available we know that cooking is out of the question since that's blake's favourite activity therefore Oliver's favourite activity must be kayaking.

Blake - Cooking
Rose - Rock Climbing
Oliver - Kayaking

Now that we know everyone else's favourite activity, abigail's favourite activity must be zip-line.

Blake - Cooking
Rose - Rock Climbing
Oliver - Kayaking
Abigail - Zip-line

## The Good Life

Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
1. playing catch
2. burying toy

Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk, so they can be
1. ears scratched
2. playing catch
3. napping
4. burying toy

Since one of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched, the following dogs could be doing this
1. Pepper
2. Ginger
3. Nutmeg

A dog not named for a spice is playing catch. So the dogs playing catch are either
1. Saber
2. Bear

Bear is getting some exercise therefore bear could be
1. playing catch
2. burying a chew toy
3. going for a walk

Based on the first statement and the 4th statement, we now know that pepper can't be playing catch therefore pepper must be burying a toy.
Pepper - Burying Toy

Based on statement 2 and our previous conclusion, the only dog that can be walking is Nutmeg.

Pepper - Burying Toy
Nutmeg - Walking

Looking at statement 3 we can conclude that ginger must be getting it's ears scratched since pepper and nutmeg are doing other activities.

Pepper - Burying Toy
Nutmeg - Walking
Ginger - Ears Scratched

Using statement 5 we can deduce that bear must be playing catch since the other 2 activities are being done by other dogs.

Pepper - Burying Toy
Nutmeg - Walking
Ginger - Ears Scratched
Bear - Playing Catch

Finally, Saber is the only one left so they must be napping.

Pepper - Burying Toy
Nutmeg - Walking
Ginger - Ears Scratched
Bear - Playing Catch
Saber - Napping
