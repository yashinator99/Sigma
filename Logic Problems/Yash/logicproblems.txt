Process:

People: Abigail, Oliver, Rosa, and Blake

So assuming that
cook, kayak, rock climb, and zip-line are in a dictionary or hashmap
for example
cook : ground
rock climbing :ground, harness, heights
kayak: water
zipline: harness, heights

so given that we go through a for loop

for ( people ) {
    checking the people requirements and comparing it
}


Since abigial dosnt like rock climbing it will be all: Cook, Kayak, Zip line
since oliver is afraid of heightszip lines and  rock climbing since they are up high and it will be cook and kayak
since rosa cant do activities without a harness zipline and rock climbing has harnesses
since Blake  likes to keep his feet on the ground we can consider rock climbing as ground and cooking as standing on the ground, and since zipline is in the air and kayak in the boat in the water
Abigail - Cook, Kayak, Zip line
Oliver - Cook kayak
Rosa - Rock climbing, zip lines
Blake - rock climbing, cooking



2)The Good Life
Process:
Pepper playing catch or burying a chew toy

Ginger Saber and Bear is not walking
nutmeg is going for a walk since Pepper is playing catch or burying a chew toy

One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.

so bear is playing catch and saber is probably sleeping since bear is the one getting exercise and not name as a spice.
