# Logic Problems

Here are some logic problems that need to be solved. The solution has to be wrote in a step by step manner, as if you were telling it to a child. This means clear instructions and no ambiguity.

If you are confident in programming, try writing the solutions with pseudo-code.

### 1. Summer Camp

Abigail, Oliver, Rosa, and Blake all attend the same summer camp, where they can cook, kayak, rock climb, and zip-line. Each child has a different favorite activity.

- Abigailâ€™s favorite activity isnâ€™t rock climbing.
- Oliver is afraid of heights.
- Rosa canâ€™t do her favorite activity without a harness.
- Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.

Can you figure out who likes what?

### 2. The Good Life

Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.

- Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
- Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk.
- One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
- A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
- Bear is getting some exercise.

Can you figure out what each dog is doing?

### 3. The Long and the Short of It

Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.

- Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
- Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
- Benito is not the shortest.

Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?

### 1. Dads and Grads

A joint Fatherâ€™s Day and graduation party is being thrown for Michael, Ken, James, Alberto, Elias, and Stephanie. Three of them are newly minted high school graduates. The other three are their dads.

- Stephanie went to the senior prom with Michaelâ€™s son.
- Elias and James played on the schoolâ€™s baseball team. One of them is Albertoâ€™s son.
- Michael and Elias are not related.

Can you match the high school graduates to their fathers at this joint celebration?

### 2. Party at Charlie's

And this one is a good logic puzzle for adults. Youâ€™ve been invited to a party at Charlieâ€™s house, but youâ€™ve never been there. He has seven friends who live nearby. Theyâ€™ve given you a map showing all of their houses and Charlieâ€™s house, along with the following information:

- Daniel: I canâ€™t see Benitaâ€™s house, because Gretaâ€™s house is in the way.
- Adam: I live directly (not diagonally) across the street from Daniel.
- Benita: Elena lives due west of me.
- Elena: I have to cross three streets to walk to Francoâ€™s house.
- Hal: I live east of Benita.

Can you figure out which house is Charlieâ€™s?

These are optional, but for each one solved you'll receive points for your team.

### 1. Pass the Salt, Please

```
        ðŸ§‚                  ðŸ§‚                  ðŸ§‚                          ðŸ§‚
A. This is salt     B. This is salt     C. This is sugar        D. The salt in not in B
```

It's April fool's day and your roommate has replaced the salt in three of your four salt shakers with sugar and left a message on each.
If only one of these inscriptions is true, which shaker still contains salt?

### 2. New Parents

Ruby and Lewis are expectingâ€¦triplets! They already know what they will name their three children, but they arenâ€™t sharing the names until the babies are born. For now, this is all theyâ€™ll say:

- All three babies are boys.
- Their names are six letters long and anagrams of one another.
- Their names include both of their parentsâ€™ initials, but none of the other letters in their parentsâ€™ first names.

What will Ruby and Lewis name their triplets?
